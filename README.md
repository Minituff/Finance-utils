## [Compile_bank_statements](Compile_bank_statements\readme.md)

Used to take muliple CSV files from your bank and combine them into one master CSV

These files are grouped either buy `purchases` or `expenses`

All csv files must be loaded in the same directory as the script file.

To run the script, just use python 3.8+:

```bash
python3 compile_bank_satements.py
```

You can also update the `config.py` which allows for full customization
